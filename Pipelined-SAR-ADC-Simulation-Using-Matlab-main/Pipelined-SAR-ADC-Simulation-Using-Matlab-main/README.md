# Pipelined-SAR-ADC-Simulation-Using-Matlab

This is a poject that simulates a simple pipelined SAR ADC with matlab.

The matlab code is in `Code` file and project report is in `Report` file

Todo:
1. Analyze the effect of noise and mismatch on static & dynamic performance
2. Write the code introduction part of the report
3. How to realize time calibration?
